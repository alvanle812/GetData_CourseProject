The tidy.txt file contains the tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
The file contains following information:
1. Id: 
    - Subject: id of 
    
1. Description of the study: 
  The purpose of this project is to process human activity data that were collected from smartphones 
  The goal is to prepare tidy data set (tidy.txt)with the average of each variable for each activity 
  and each subject (experiment participant)

2. Structure of the data within the tidy.txt file: 
  ## Id (Identifier): 
      # Subject: id of the participants
      # Activity: six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
  ## Features: Means and Standard Deviations of different sensor signals
